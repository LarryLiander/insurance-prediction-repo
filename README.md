# Description
This python file is about creating a model to predict whether new customer would like to accept our insurance offerings or not.
To build the model, we need dataset that contains the history of customer data that accept or decline our offerings

# Methodology
K-Nearest Neighbors is the approach that used to build the model.
For data preprocessing, we used label encoder to transform non numerical attributes.
and MinMaxScaler to normalize the numerical attributes.

# How-to use
### 1. Open the .ipynb file using Google colab
### 2. upload the train.csv file
### 3. run the code from top to bottom
### 4. Have some play with the model
